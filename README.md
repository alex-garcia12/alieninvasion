# alien_invasion

This was a variation of the original Atari game of Space Invaders. This project was written in Python, using the PyCharm IDE. This project isn't necessarily meant to be a replica of Space Invaders, but as a jumpstart into game programming, design, and writing in Python. This was my first exposure to using Python, and I'm happy with the result despite how simple the game appears.

============================================================================== 

Works

-Player can control the ship; they can move left, right, and shoot.

-Aliens approach the player similarly to the way they do in Space Invaders. They slowly come down and increase speed as the player progresses throughout the game.

-Score tracking works

-Player ship can be destroyed upon contact with an alien. Player can also lose a limited number of lives and the game restarts as a result

==============================================================================

Doesn't Really Work

-Animations leave a bit to be desired

-Extra features such as enemies shooting back and cover for the player to hide under were not implemented
